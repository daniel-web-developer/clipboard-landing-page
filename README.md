### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Not that I learned it now, but this project reminded me of how important it is to ALWAYS check if your Sass files are updating haha.

### Continued development

I could either add a new breakpoint or calculate distances in terms of percentages, not pixels. It would make the website look more like the original design.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7415872/change-color-of-png-image-via-css) - With this, I was able to change the colours of the 3 social media icons on the footer.
